  I created this website as a digital notebook to keep and share my notes on various technical topics (mainly related to mathematics, programming, and finance) as well as my experience working as a quant. 

  I love creating data visualisations as a tool to communicate complex ideas as well as provide powerful insights from data. This is why you will see lots of plots in this site.


  
  Random facts about me:

  - In my free time, I enjoy reading (both fiction and non-fiction), practicing yoga, and learning random things

  - I like insects ðŸª²
  
  As you can see, my site has no ads, no tracking, no sponsored posts, and no paywall. My only motivation is to share some of what I have learned with anybody who is interested."
