My name is Dialid, I am a mathematician with over eight years of experience as a Quantitative Analyst (a.k.a. quant). 

I was born in Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ and moved to the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ to do a PhD in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Warwick. After finishing my studies, I came to London to pursue a career in Finance. 

Currently, I work in the Cross-Asset Front Office Strat team at Bank of America.
